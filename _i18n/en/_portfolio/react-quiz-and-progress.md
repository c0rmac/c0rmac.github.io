Build a Questionnaire with a progress bar for React Js app.
[Click here](https://github.com/c0rmac/react-quiz-and-progress/blob/main/README.ga.MD) to see the README in Irish Gaelic. 

## Motivation
In 2020, I was working on an application called [House of Costs](https://c0rmac.github.io/portfolio/house-of-costs/)
in which a user personalised questionnaire was asked to be fulfilled by
the end user. The questionnaire had various levels of complexity, as answering certain answers
to certain questions would trigger followup questions. This would give the impression
to the end-user that the Questionnaire could be a long slog, especially by
the fact that there was no indication as to how much more of the Questionnaire the
user would have to complete.

In turn, this motivated the idea of having a linear progress bar which would
indicate intuitively to the user how much of the questionnaire the user has completed.

As the user answers more questions, the more the progress bar progresses. For
questions that are "independent" (ie: do not depend on previous answers to previous questions),
a large progress increment is rewarded to the progress bar. For "dependent" questions,
a smaller increment is rewarded to the progress bar. For questions that are "dependent" questions
that are dependent on other questions (and that are dependent on other questions and so on),
an even smaller increment is rewarded to the progress bar.

## Demonstration
If you're interested in trying out the plugin without any setup, I encourage you to take a look
at code [demo here](https://github.com/c0rmac/react-quiz-and-progress/tree/main/demo).
You will need to open the demo in Intelij Idea as it is a Kotlin Js project.
I use material-ui as the basis of the interface.

## Technical Details
The plugin was developed in Kotlin React Js (since I use Multiplatform Kotlin by nature).
I will publish more of the technical details of my plugin on my blog soon.

## Overview

### QuestionSetProgressController
This class provides the state of the Questionnaire, such as progress made,
determining the next question and when the Questionnaire is complete. It
should be placed in the state class.

```kotlin
QuestionSetProgressController(
    proposedQuestionSet = ProposedQuestionSet(
        // Place all the questions you want to ask here. See the next section
        // for more specific details
        questions = arrayOf(
            Question(id = 1, question = "Question 1",
                dependentAnswerIds = emptySet(), dependentQuestionID = null,
                answers = listOf(
                    Answer(id = 1, answer = "Answer 1"),
                    Answer(id = 2, answer = "Answer 2"),
                    Answer(id = 3, answer = "Answer 3"),
                    Answer(id = 4, answer = "Answer 4"),
                    Answer(id = 5, answer = "Answer 5"),
                )
            )
        ), 
        // A map from Qustion.id to Answer.id. That is, if the end user
        // chooses the answer with id=3 for question with id=1, the map will be
        // assigned with 1->3
        answerSet = mutableMapOf(), 
        // Define a prefilled answer set, if needed
        defaultAnswerSet = null
    ),
    // Specify the current question the end user is on
    currentQuestionID = 1,
    // Some callbacks
    questionOnChange = ::questionOnChange,
    questionSetOnFulfilled = ::questionSetOnFulfilled
)
```

### Question
We can define questions and parameterize them as independent questions that will always
be asked no matter what, and dependent questions which depend on the answer given
to previous questions. Here is an example of a question set
```kotlin
arrayOf(
    // An example of an independent question
    Question(
        id = 1, question = "Question 1",
        dependentAnswerIds = emptySet(), 
        // The independence is characterised by the fact that dependentQuestionID = null
        dependentQuestionID = null,
        answers = listOf(
            Answer(id = 1, answer = "Answer 1"),
            Answer(id = 2, answer = "Answer 2"),
            Answer(id = 3, answer = "Answer 3"),
            Answer(id = 4, answer = "Answer 4"),
            Answer(id = 5, answer = "Answer 5"),
        )
    ),
    // An example of a dependent question
    Question(
        id = 2, question = "Question 1.1",
        // As opposed to the previous question, we have assigned dependentQuestionID = 1
        // and dependentAnswerIds is assigned a set.
        // That is, this question, question with id = 2, will be asked if and only if
        // answer with ids 2 or 3 is selected in question with id = 1.
        dependentQuestionID = 1,
        dependentAnswerIds = setOf(2, 3),
        answers = listOf(
            Answer(id = 1, answer = "Answer 1"),
            Answer(id = 2, answer = "Answer 2"),
            Answer(id = 3, answer = "Answer 3")
        )
    )
)
```

## Setup
There are various ways that you may choose to setup the questionnaire. I preferred
to setup the questionnaire using react router to present each question by its own "page".

I'd also like to warn you that I have not switched to using more modern
React Js coding conventions, so I apologise for my dinosaur code. 

### Javascript ES6 (Regular React Js project)
I will publish instructions on this in the future as I am no longer familiar with ES6 anymore.
But it should be similar to the Kotlin Js setup, provided you are
somewhat comfortable with reading basic Kotlin. Help here would be very welcome!

As usual, you can retrieve the plugin by running the following

``` 
npm i react-quiz-and-progress
```

### Kotlin Js
In your build.gradle.kts file, add the following
```kotlin
// Required dependency
implementation(npm("react-quiz-and-progress","1.0.0"))

// Usual Kotlin React Js (legacy) dependencies
implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-react-legacy:18.2.0-pre.479")
implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-react-dom-legacy:18.2.0-pre.479")
implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-styled:5.3.6-pre.479")
implementation("org.jetbrains.kotlin-wrappers:kotlin-react-router-dom:5.2.0-pre.256-kotlin-1.5.31")
implementation(npm("react-router-transition", "2.0.0"))
implementation(npm("glamor", "2.20.40"))
implementation(npm("react-visibility-sensor", "5.1.1"))
implementation(npm("react-animate-height", "2.0.21"))
```

fun main() {
    window.onload = {
        val container = document.getElementById("root") ?: error("Couldn't find root container!")
        console.log("Container", container)
        render(container) {
            hashRouter {
                route("/") {
                    welcomeWithRouter.invoke {
                        attrs.name = "Kotlin/JS"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

(Optional) AnimatedSwitch.kt
```kotlin

import com.trinitcore.quizprogress.demo.wrapper.reactroutertransition.animatedSwitch

    this.position = "relative"
    this["& > div"] = js {
        this.position = "absolute"
    }
})

private fun glide(value: Double): dynamic {
    return spring(value, js("{ stiffness: 174, damping: 24 }"))
}

fun RBuilder.animatedSwitch(handler: RHandler<AnimatedSwitchProps>)
        = this@animatedSwitch.animatedSwitch(className = "view-holder-container") {
    attrs {
        atEnter = js { }
        atEnter.asDynamic().offset = 100

        atLeave = js { }
        atLeave.asDynamic().offset = glide(-100.0)

        atActive = js { }
        atActive.asDynamic().offset = glide(0.0)

        switchRule = hOCSwitchRule
        mapStyles = { styles: dynamic ->
            js {
                if (styles.offset == 0) {
                    transform = "unset"
                } else transform = "translateX(" + styles.offset + "%)"
            }
        }
    }

    handler.invoke(this)
}
```
