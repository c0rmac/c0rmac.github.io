I am a part-time software engineer. I am training in Mathematics and Statistics as a postgraduate course at Trinity College Dublin and I am in my fourth year. This is the last year of my undergraduate degree and I intend to do a postgraduate course afterwards.

Pure Mathematics
======
I am interested in Abstract Algebra topics, ie. Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry. I attended Number Theory classes in the second year and will attend Algebraic Geometry classes next year.

Applied Mathematics
======
I am interested in Machine learning topics, especially those related to Markov processes. I am working on a project for my undergraduate degree - The Self-External Walks.

I would like to apply my knowledge of Algebra topics in cryptography.

Irish
======
I am interested in Connamara Irish, especially √Årainn Irish and Cois Fharraige Irish. I love to translating common everyday things into Irish and I publish translations for games, books and TV shows.
