I am currently undertaking my degree in Mathematics & Statistics in Trinity College Dublin, which I am due to complete in May 2023. I have plans to undertake a postgraduate degree in Applied Mathematics as well in the Technical University of Munich. My professsional interests include Software Engineering, Statistical Modelling and I have future interests in applied cryptography and combining it with 'Big data' models.

Pure Mathematics
======
I am interested in Abstract Algebra topics, ie. Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry. I attended Number Theory classes in my second year and I am currently attending Algebraic Geometry classes at the moment.

Applied Mathematics
======
I am interested in Machine learning topics, especially those related to Markov processes. I am currently working on an Applied Mathematics project for my undergraduate degree - The Self-Avoiding Walks. I have invested interests in topics relating to Machine Learning on Graphs as well. I also seek to apply my knowledge of Algebra topics in cryptography.

Irish
======
I am interested in Connamara Irish, especially √Årainn Irish and Cois Fharraige Irish. I have made a hobby of translating common everyday things into Irish and I publish translations for games, books and TV shows. You can see more of my work [here](http://gaeilgechuncinn.ie)

Note that I also go by my Irish Gaelic surname "Cinnsealach".
