Part-time software engineer and currently training in Mathematics and Statistics for my postgraduate degree at Trinity College Dublin. I am currently in my fourth (and final) year. I intend to undertake a postgraduate degree in Applied Mathematics in TUM afterwards. I also go by my Irish Gaelic surname "Cinnsealach".

Pure Mathematics
======
I am interested in Abstract Algebra topics, ie. Number Theory and Algebraic Geometry. I attended Number Theory classes in the second year and will attend Algebraic Geometry classes next year.

Applied Mathematics
======
I am interested in Machine learning topics, especially those related to Markov processes. I am working on a project for my undergraduate degree - The Self-External Walks.

I seek to apply my knowledge of Algebra topics in cryptography.

Irish
======
I am interested in Connamara Irish, especially √Årainn Irish and Cois Fharraige Irish. I have made a hobby of translating common everyday things into Irish and I publish translations for games, books and TV shows. You can see more of my work [here](http://gaeilgechuncinn.ie)
